### Two sample for the Merge Interval Problem

In this piece of code you will find two possible solutions to the merge interval problem.
It is specially divided into the complex and the simple solution.
It should be noted that the time complexity in the first example is O (n2), while in the second example the sorting is O (n log n).

The decisive difference here lies in the memory consumption which can be shown on the basis of O (n2) in the first example, while in the simple example O (logN) lies behind it. It is important to note that the sorting is also burdened with computing time and O (logN) beforehand.

Conclusion:
Depending on the amount, one or the other example can be used. The complex version is recommended for processes involving large amounts of data. While the second solution is the simplest and cheapest approach for manageable amounts of data.
